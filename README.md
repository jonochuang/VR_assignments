XR class assignments

HI there, 

I created this maze off the base maze created by the instructor as an example. I tried to tweak it a bit to resemble the Office's annex but found that 
the parts were insufficient from this set. I mostly used Ctrl+D to replicate the items and move them around. I added a couple of things from my other 
libraries, including a monster head (since it's near Halloween) and an unflattering picture of my friend Tab, since she was over my place when I was 
testing the game. Here's the link to the picture of my friend:

Here's the link to the asset package (but it costs $29. Happy to remove it)

Everything else was just duplicated and rearranged.
